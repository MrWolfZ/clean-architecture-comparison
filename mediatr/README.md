# CQS with MediatR

This file is a _work-in-progress_.

- well-known library
- supports commands and queries (requests) as well as events (notifications)
- cross-cutting concerns via behaviors
- layer of indirection that makes code difficult to navigate
- no distinction between commands and queries
- behaviors not configurable
